            NASTY comics will engage with or be entirely about heavy themes, blood, gore, sex, abuse, etc.
            and will often portray these things in upsetting or graphic detail.
            <br><br>
            Summaries here will be written my me unless stated otherwise and may not reflect how the authors would
            describe their work.
            Some of them might not 
            appreciate being called "NASTY" but look. I'm doin my best here!!

            From the about page: "Daughter of the Lord of Thieves, Sette Frummagem is on a mission, and she'll lie, cheat, and steal to make sure
            its a success (she'll lie, cheat, and steal anyway). Condemned to aid her in her rotten endeavours is
            a rotten corpse who seems oddly talented with the supernatural, and oddly not laying motionless in the dirt."

            Honestly not sure how to describe this one? Lots of gore, murder, and transgender shit. Also one of the funniest comics
            I have ever read.
            <br><br>A quote from the about page reads: "FFAK is a story about killing the monsters.
            Or I could say FFAK is a sci-fi action dark comedy horror erotica? story about Man Eating worms."
