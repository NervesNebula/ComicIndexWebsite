            CHILL comics can range from slice of life to high fantasy to sci-fi and even horror. The key difference here
            is that while they might not stray from the kinds of themes that NASTY comics have, if they do engage in those
            topics it probably won't be as explicit or heavy about it. 

            <br><br>
            Summaries here will be written my me unless stated otherwise and may not reflect how the authors would
            describe their work.

            One of the funniest comics I've ever read. From the about page: "SAKANA is a slice-of-life, romantic comedy (a sli-li-rom-com, if you will) that
            takes place in the Tsukiji Fish Market in Tokyo, Japan. If follows the lives of a few 20-somethings working at the market, their friends and family,
            and all the wacky situations they constantly find themselves in despite their best efforts.
            Basically they all want to date each other, but they're all terrible at it, and also there's lots of seafood involved."

            dreadlocked vagrant, frying eggs and singing Paul Simon in his kitchen. <br><br>

            The agreement is simple: Amal does the driving; TJ pays the way - 
            but a 3500 mile journey leaves plenty of time for things to get complicated."
